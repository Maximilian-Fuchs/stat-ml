Datasets are denoted as $\textbf{X} = \begin{pmatrix}
x_{11} & x_{12} & \cdots & x_{1p}\\
x_{21} & x_{22} & \cdots & x_{2p}\\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots\\
x_{n1} & x_{n2} & \cdots & x_{np}
\end{pmatrix}
$ where $n$ is the number of *examples* and $p$ is the number of *features*.

*Features* are called *variables* in the book.
